a cult is a [person/organisation/part of yourself] that makes an _implicit promise_ to fulfill your need for [acceptance/love/purpose/immortality/etc]. 

to the extent that this trade is unseen, and the greater your needs for [XYZ], the more you will feed your energy into the cult. 

in a way, it is a pact with the devil. you only make pacts when you have a special need that cannot be obtained through usual means.
