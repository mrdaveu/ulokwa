Do nothing.

###### Dear jul-2025 Me, 
###### You are currently dissatisfied with your experience. Your understanding of this is the belief that 'fun is hard', and you are anguishing over this. What if you never had fun? What if you (oh no) _couldn't_ have fun? 
###### This was a wrong conception of the problem. But you tried anyways and made this cute short film to explore the question: 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8nRX68bh4JM?si=ybhkop3N3JQCLAbF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

###### The problem is not the belief that 'having fun is difficult for me' - the problem is the habitual dissatisfaction with experience. 

###### In other words, perhaps it is an accurate description that there is no fun to be had where you are right now. But this isn't such a big deal without the _feeling of lack_. "I am lacking fun"—this is what causes difficulty. 

###### This crystallised when I had an experience with a friend at a party. I shared this with him afterwards: 

> hey __redacted__ - i remember we were outside the patio during the party and you know, with your flamboyant outfits, i feel like you are the queen of the party. you asked me how the night was going, and i said i felt like i was floating around. 

> then, you shared that you felt the same way. But you didn't need the party to be experienced in a certain way or another. "my experience is my experience".

> I think the way you said it, the way you believed and felt it fully, is helping me really see it and drop my dissatisfaction with experience. 

###### So, how to have fun is succinctly summarised in two words: "Do nothing". My experience is my experience, and I welcome it fully.
