        <p><em>In which the partner receiving will lay down, and the partner giving will rest his hands underneath her cranium for 15 minutes.</em></p>
<p>If you want to explore relational touch / pre-conceptual communication between bodies, I have found this posture to facilitate meaningful experiences between untrained peers. To avoid setting any expectations, I will refrain from mentioning any potential experiences. Choose someone you instinctually trust.</p>
<p>At minimum, I recommend you set out 1 hour of quiet time so each partner can experience both roles with plenty of time to explore without feeling rushed.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Requires:<br>
– A partner<br>
– A quiet space<br>
– A hard floor (e.g. yoga mat)</p>
<p><em>For the person receiving:</em><br>
Lay down comfortably on your back.</p>
<p>Get a sense of yourself and where you are. It may be helpful to say internally, I am here. Get a sense of your partner’s body in relation to you, and get a sense of the space around you.</p>
<p>Notice what comes up. You may ask to stop at any time.</p>
<p><em>For the person giving:</em><br>
Craniosacral is a listening-first approach. Drop any intention of wanting to change or fix anything.</p>
<p>Get a sense of yourself and where you are. It may be helpful to say internally, I am here. Get a sense of your partner’s body in relation to you, and get a sense of the space around you.</p>
<p>When you feel settled, approach your partner.</p>
<p>Find a posture where your hips are close and pointed to your partner’s head, and spine relatively upright. You may cross or bend your knees.</p>
<p>Cup your hands below your partner’s head.</p>
<p>Imagine that your touch is so light, that you could sense if your partner’s toes twitched. If you notice the sense of attention falling only your partner, include your own body equally in awareness.</p>
<p>Then, do nothing.</p>
